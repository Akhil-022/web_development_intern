**ABSTRACT**

This internship report explores the field of Web Development about how a website is created using front end development tools, back-end development tools and communication between those tools. The report begins by providing an overview of Web Development and its ability to provide developers with a comprehensive understanding of the entire web development process. It then introduces the software we use such as Oracle SQL Developer, Apache Tomcat server, Eclipse and Microsoft Front Page where we get into detail about each
software and how it helps us in designing a web application.

The report delves into various web development tools such as Microsoft Front Page Tool, which we have used, to build an attractive User Interface (UI) for users. We have used Eclipse tool to establish the connection between the User Interface and the database by having some JavaScript programs. We have used Oracle SQL Developer as our Back-end Database for sheltering the information.

Further, the report explores about the problem statement where we see how to fabricate a Web application using various software tools. Next, the report guides us how to install and setup Oracle SQL Developer, Apache Tomcat Server, Eclipse, and Microsoft front page.

We then develop codes for various CRUD operations as required for our Web application such as insert, retrieve, update, and delete. We work on both front end and back end and even instigate the communication between front end and back end. Finally, we have a turnout, a registration form which entails many fields like First Name, Last Name, Extension Number, Project, etc. on which we can perform all the necessary CRUD operations.

Lastly, the report concludes about how a website is created, the tools we used and the concepts we use to understand and tackle the problem statement. The
report offers valuable insights into the field of web development. This project aims to serve as a valuable resource for businesses, organizations, and
individuals seeking to create a more engaging and accessible online presence
